# Substack_Scraper
## A tool to export your articles from the Substack writing platform
### v: 0.01

Hey there! My name's Tristan Isham. I'm a writer on substack and if you're looking at this repo, chances you are too. The platform is great but it lacks some essential tools like the ability to export your posts. That's why I built Substack_Scraper. It's a little Ruby program that'll scrape your blog and output your post in a CMS friendly format.
